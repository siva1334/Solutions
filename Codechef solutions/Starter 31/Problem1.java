/*
Chef's professor is planning to give his class a group assignment. 
There are 2N students in the class, with distinct roll numbers ranging from 1 to 2N. Chef's roll number is X.

The professor decided to create N groups of 2 students each. The groups were created as follows:
the first group consists of roll numbers 1 and 2N, the second group of roll numbers 2 and 2Nâˆ’1, and so on, with the final group consisting of roll numbers N and N+1.

Chef wonders who his partner will be. Can you help Chef by telling him the roll number of his partner?

/*
Chef wants to store some important numerical data on his personal computer.
He is using a new data type that can store values only from 0 till N both inclusive.
If this data type receives a value greater than N then it is cyclically converted to fit into the range 0 to N. For example:

Value N+1 will be stored as 0.
Value N+2 will be stored as 1.
and so onâ€¦

Given X, the value chef wants to store in this new data type. Determine what will be the actual value in memory after storing X
